Hello,
I have chosen to create an application using Bootstrap v4, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5.

- All functions are working well except I need to finish the (remove player from table button) and (configure POINTS area inside table, because I really did not understand how it is calculated).
- I have installed  a small search engine to find player's match history (works without button).
- I have displayed a list of tweets by hashtag #pingpong.
- Some design changes (blinking text on the top of the page).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my choices.

I am going to continue my work on this project because of following purposes:
- Need to study about CSS pre/post-processors and apply them.
- Need to study about task runners.

In conclusion: thank you for your attention. :)

Have a good day,
Lukas
