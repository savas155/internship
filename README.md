Good evening,
I have chose to create an application using Bootstrap v4, jQuery, CSS3 and HTML5.

Actually I needed around 1.5 hour to complete the task fully.

- I used Javascript power to save results inside arrays (so after refresh it disappears). If I had more time, there is no doubt that I would use MySQL dabatase and PHP.
- Application does not work fully, I need to complete top '5 players' table, finish 'latest games' section.

Thank you for giving me opportunity. I cannot describe how much I appreciate it. 

I hope we are going see each other soon.

Have a nice evening :)
Lukas
